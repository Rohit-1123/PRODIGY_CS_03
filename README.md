## How It Works

| Criteria                            | 
|-------------------------------------|
| Length ≥ 8 characters               | 
| Contains uppercase letters (A–Z)    | 
| Contains lowercase letters (a–z)    | 
| Contains digits (0–9)               | 
| Contains special characters (!@#$%) | 

- **Score 0–2** → Weak  
- **Score 3–4** → Moderate  
- **Score 5** → Strong
